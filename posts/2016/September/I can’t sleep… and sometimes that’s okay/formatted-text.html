<p style="text-align: justify;">In general, people think sleep deprivation is a bad thing. I must say that I think they are absolutely right. Nothing ruins my following day like a bad night's sleep, I'm sure most people would agree with me on this. I wake up tired, in a bad mood and it's extremely difficult to leave my bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As bad as it sounds, sometimes it's okay not to sleep at a regular time. Believe me. I usually use this free time I would <em>waste</em> sleeping trying to make something productive like studying, searching career goals, composing, writing for the first time for this blog or, who knows, maybe even cleaning my room. Okay, the last one I can leave for another sleepless night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you forget what time it is, everything else contributes to doing these things. There's peace, silence and loneliness the likes of which you would rarely have at a regular time of the day. I'm sure you can find a regular activity of your everyday life that would be benefitted from this time of day. However, as much as you can enjoy the insomnia-sponsored free time, the world we live in is not ready to embrace people who do that. It's better this way. If it was the case, there would be no point in staying up since so many people would too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So it's a hard time to enjoy since you'd probably be tired from the rest of the day and it makes you even more tired for the next day.. Why should you even bother using it for anything other than sleeping? Well, you shouldn't. I don't think it's a good path to follow deliberately. I only advise you to use this time if you're already there, after all, things can't get any worse and you can still make the best of a bad situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's 6am. Today I couldn't sleep.. and that's okay. I hope I don't get used to it.</p>
